As the tradition requires,
here's the Anzen "Hello, World!",
as a nice and elegant one-liner:

```anzen
print("Hello, World!")
// Prints "Hello, World!"
```

Running this program is as easy at copy-pasting it into a file,
say `hello_world.anzen`,
and execute it with the Anzen interpreter:

```bash
anzen hello_world.anzen
```

Anzen syntax heavily borrows from that of modern programming languages such as
[Swift](https://swift.org) and [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org).
Like in those languages,
programs in Anzen are made of a statements
that are executed sequentially to manipulate some kind of data.
Semicolons at the end of statements are optional (and discouraged).

The following pages give a bite-sized tour of Anzen's core features,
and can be used as an information introduction to the language.

Anzen still being in active development,
some of the features presented in this tutorial are not implemented yet
